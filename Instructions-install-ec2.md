### Important:
Creating SSH keys on the Jenkins server and distributing them to  your servers ensures a secure connection between the servers. 
 Testing the connection by SSH'ing into your other servers from Jenkins' server 
 verifies that the servers can connect without manual intervention and adds the 
 servers to the "list of known hosts‚Äù. A "known host" is a remote server that your system recognizes and trusts for SSH connections based on its stored public key. 
 This is important because it helps to ensure secure and verified SSH connections.
